<h1>Survey
Details:</h1>

</div>

<span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"></span><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> My group
is interested in creating tools to help blind programmers. The goal of
this work is to better understand the needs and challenges faced by
blind programmers. To do so, I am conducting a <span class="il">survey</span>
on the barriers encountered
as they learned to program. We would also like to invite some
participants to take part in follow-up interviews to expound upon their
answers and gain more details about the barriers they have faced. You
will be able to indicate at the end of the survey if you would be
willing to participate in the follow-up interviews.<br>

<br>

The survey is intended to be completed by adults who have completed an
undergraduate degree in computer science or a related field and used a
screen reader while completing that degree. If you meet the criteria
and are one of the first 100 people to complete the survey answering at
least half the questions, and you provide your information, you will
receive a $5 Amazon gift card. Please note, responses deemed to be spam
will not receive compensation. Those who are interviewed as a follow up
to the survey will receive a $30 Amazon gift card. The survey should
take approximately 15 minutes. The follow-up interview should take
approximately an hour. <br>
