  <p>Each year, Creighton University awards Clare Boothe Luce

  Science to students entering their junior or senior year. The Clare
  Boothe Luce Undergraduate Scholarships for Undergraduate Women in
  Science cover the full cost of tuition and fees and include a $2500 housing

<h2>Criteria</h2>

<ul>

  <li>Be a current sophomore or junior (to be funded during junior or senior
    year).</li>

<br>
<h2><a id="Selection">Selection Process</a></h2>
<p> To be considered for a Clare Boothe Luce Scholarship, a student must be
  nominated by a faculty member in one of Creightonâ€™s natural science,
  mathematics or computer science departments or submit her name directly to
  the current Clare Boothe Luce
    Professor, Dr. Baker at <a href="mailto:catherinebaker@creighton.edu">catherinebaker@creighton.edu</a> by the end of the Fall semester. Candidates undergo
  initial screening to eliminate those who do not meet the eligibility
  requirements of the Luce scholarship. </p>
<p>Candidates who pass the initial screening will be invited to apply for
  the scholarship early in the spring semester. The scholarship application
  materials are available online and completed applications are due in the
  middle of the spring semester.&nbsp; Applicants should work closely with a
  research supervisor (usually a professor in a science/mathematics/computer
  science department at Creighton or within Nebraska) to complete the
  "proposed plan of research" in the scholarship application. The ideal
  candidate will have begun, or made firm plans to begin, a research project
  in the fall or spring semester of the current year. </p>
<p>Those who respond to the invitation are evaluated by a Selection
  Committee comprised of faculty members from the science, mathematics and
  computer science departments. The committee will include active science
  researchers with strong representation from women scientists. The
  Selection Committee will review all the application materials and may
  desire to interview the top candidates. The committee will then submit the
  final list of names to the Dean of the College.</p>
<p>The Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences will announce the winners of
  the scholarships in a timely fashion (shortly before May 1) to coincide
  with announcements from the <a href="http://www.creighton.edu/financialaid/">Office
    of Financial Aid</a>. </p>
<h2>Clare Boothe Luce Scholars</h2>
<p> Over 60 of Creighton's Clare Boothe Luce Scholars have gone on to
  graduate school in science. Of these, several have gone on to earn
  post-doctoral and faculty positions (including two of Creighton's
  Chemistry professors). Other scholars have pursued careers secondary
  education, law, and science communication.&nbsp; </p>
